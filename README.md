# Auto-Music-Gen 🎵🎹

Auto-Music-Gen is an exhilarating research project 📚🔬 that delves into the fascinating world of music generation, specifically focusing on the enchanting realm of piano melodies.

## 🎶 Harmonizing Art and Technology
Our project centers around investigating the profound impact of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks on the innovative field of music composition. We explore how this advanced technology can breathe new life into musical creativity.

## 📂 Data Symphony
We kickstarted our journey by curating an eclectic collection of midi files from various piano virtuosos 🎹🎵. This diverse musical repository serves as the foundation for our exploration.

## 🎼 The Music21 Maestro
Leveraging the power of the Music21 library in Python 🐍, we embarked on a journey of musical discovery. We meticulously extracted intricate features from the music data, unraveling the mesmerizing world of chord pitches, rhythms, and beyond.

## 🎵 Composing with Algorithms
The heart of our endeavor lies in understanding the underlying patterns within the compositions of different maestros. Through the application of LSTM models, we deciphered the intricate threads that weave these musical masterpieces together.

## 🔍 Unveiling Musical Insights
We embarked on an insightful journey, studying the nuances of each composer's unique style. With every note and tempo, we decoded the language of music, gaining deeper insights into the artistry behind the compositions.

## 🎹 Harmonious Creation
Building upon the knowledge gained, we harnessed the power of LSTM-generated patterns to compose new pieces of music. The result? A harmonious blend of human artistry and algorithmic creativity, breathing life into compositions reminiscent of the original composers.

## 🌟 Elevating Musical Creativity
Auto-Music-Gen isn't just about generating music; it's about pushing the boundaries of musical creativity. Our project showcases the exciting synergy between technology and art, where the digital realm coalesces with the melodies of human expression.

## 🎓 Join the Symphony
Curious minds and music aficionados alike, we invite you to join us in this symphonic exploration. Let's harmonize technology and art, creating musical compositions that resonate with the heart and soul.
